## 👋 Hi, I'm Wafi

Self-taught backend dev who occasionally wanders into frontend territory and immediately regrets it.
I mostly code for fun and for my personal use cases.

**TUI > GUI.**
If something can be done in the terminal, it *will* be done in the terminal  
(except web browsing — Don't even try).

---

## 🧠 Tech & Languages

**Comfortable with**
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML

**Getting there**
- C

**Currently bullying me**
- C++
- Rust
- Zig  
(nothing personal, I just haven’t wrestled them into submission yet)

---

## 🛠️ How I code

- Backend-first mindset
- Likes small tools, weird utilities, and low-level experiments
- Refactors aggressively once something “works”
- Not afraid to throw code away and start over

You may question my design decisions.  
I question them too — that’s part of the process.

---

## 🤖 AI stance

- I sometimes use generative AI as a *tool* (debugging, ideas, explanations)
- Not a fan of image/video gen AI
- Strong preference for understanding *why* something works, not just that it does (will get cthulu'd if you show me a rabbit hole too deep)

---

## 🖥️ Environment

Absolute terminal hermit.  
Editors, debuggers, file managers — if there’s a CLI version, I’ll use it.

Oh and yea, before you ask, this was refactored by AI.
